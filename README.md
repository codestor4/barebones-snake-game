# barebones-snake-game
A simple barebones HTML/JS snake game.

## Features
- Snake can move in any direction using arrow keys.
- Snake can move through walls and come back from the other side.
- A fruit appears at random places (and reappears in a new position after eaten).
- Snake grows in size after eating the fruit.

## Future Challenges
- Snake should die if it hits itself.
- A scoring system.
- Options to start, pause and end game.
- The fruit should not spawn within the body of the Snake.
- Eating the fruit should make a sound.
- Options to toggle sound.
- Snake should not be allowed to move in the opposite direction (only left/right is much better IMO).
- Snake's speed should increment once it eats the fruit.
